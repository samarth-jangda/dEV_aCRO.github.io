                        <blockquote> A) About Data Science</blockquote>
                        Data is something that can either bring a business too down or highly earned. So, I believe that data is backbone of every industry
                        and is never-ending because only data can make companies grow in future. So, I also concluded that data science is going to provide numerous jobs in future
                        and with this vision I started learning data science. I start my journey of data science from python and going on upto machine learning & neural networks.
                        <blockquote>After getting an experience of 1 year working in ml and python I prepared an NILM ( Non Intrusive Load Monitoring ) dashboard in DASH (a data science framework for python).</blockquote>
                                    <blockquote>
                                      B) Problem Statement
                                    </blockquote>
                                  It is very difficult job for a human measure the 'load of an elecronic device' every minute/second and find out which device is exceeding its limit
                                  But, yes this task is possible for a machine so I need to prepare an alogorithm that continuosly monitors load of an electronic device.
                                    <blockquote>
                                      C) Solution
                                    </blockquote>
                                  The data is getting captured in excel from the electronic device on which I prepared an alogithm in python using dash . Using this data I plot a scatter graph
                                  on which the x is (active power of transformer) and y is (reactive power os transformer) . By plotting these two parameters we can calculate load from scatter graph.

                                  Now let's say I want to save the data points which are overload with the name of any label (for eg Label_1) so I can also save it and then visualize.
                                  <blockquote>
                                    C) Future Scope
                                  </blockquote>
                                  Let's say I am having a load monitoring centre that is connected with all the electronic devices of a particular state. Now by using NILM I can control
                                  the load of all the devices which in turn help end user in consumption of electricitya and money .

                                <h3>1) Problem we were solving </h3> <br>
                                Analyzing an affinity credit card (special card only available to members of a specific group). Think of it like this - the credit card company is like Citibank and the affiliated
                                group is a company like Indian Oil or Barista. The affiliated group has to pay some fees to credit card company (because the credit card company is providing this service to the group.
                               <br>
                                Facts:<br>
                              1) average card balance is Rs 1000<br>
                              2) each card has an interest rate of 15%<br>
                              3) membership fee is Rs 20 per card<br>
                              4) loss rate is 3% (NOTE: what are the interpretations of this ? state your assumption CLEARLY when solving<br>
                              5) Rs 25 operating cost per card<br>
                              6) Rs 10 affiliation fee per card (cost to the group organization itself, so that their members get this awesome card program.<br>
                              7) 6.5% cost of funds (that credit card company must pay to the bank where it gets money<br>
                              8) bill/statement is issued on 1st of every month<br>
                              9) credit-free period = 15 days from the bill/statement issue date.<br>

                              <br>
                             Given:<br>
                              i) The interest rate is simple interest.<br>
                             ii) Interest is calculated on a daily basis.<br>
                            iii) The average card balance is the average end of month balance.<br>
                             iv) All members are more than a year old.<br>

                             <blockquote>What we are trying to find</blockquote>
                             Q1: How much profit % is generated in 1 year?<br>

                             Q2: The 3% loss rate can either mean either 3% of the outstanding balance defaults or 3% of the borrowers default on their entire balance. If the average balance is increased to $2000, what happens to the loss?<br>

                             Q3: Is a borrower with a low balance more or less likely to default then a borrower with a high balance? Why ? explain clearly<br>

                             Q4: The group company has now become unhappy with the credit card provider. it wants to start its own credit card. But for that, it will need to purchase the customers from the current credit card company. If the affilated group offered Rs 20 per account to purchase all the customers from the credit card company, what would there profit be? (assume that we are only talking about 1 year<br>

                             Q5: What numbers can the financial institution change to convince the affiliated group not to want to purchase, while still not going into a loss? Give a range of what the new numbers are (min and max)<br>

                             Q6: What is the extra cost(if any) company will have to incur if the customer delays the payment of the credit card bill after the due date?<br>

                             Q7: Is it beneficial for the company if the customer pays the credit card bill after the due date? (express your views as a business strategy analyst with a short example
                              <br>

                               <h3>2) Solution:</h3><br>

                               Consider 1000 customers for both the scenario, divide these 1000 customers into following groups<br>
                            (upon your assumption and understanding about the credit lending industry)<br>
                            <br>
                            1.customers who pay the bill within the credit-free period<br>
                            2.customers paying 30 days after the last due date<br>
                            3.customer paying 45 days after the last due date<br>
                            4.customer paying 60 days after the last due date<br>
                            (remove these customers for the complete calculation of the next month, basically, you are not supposed to provide further credit services to these customers)<br>
                            We will go point wise, since the following question is much big hence, I will be dividing this doc in three parts as:<br>
                            <br>
                            Part 1: I will explain all the terms which are used in the following task and the meaning of facts given above.<br>

                            Part 2: Approach and Analysis: I will be showing my in-depth analysis using python and how K-means clustering help in classifying the category of people that can give good profit.   <br>

                            Part 3: I will provide the solution for other questions asked in the following task.<br>
                             <blockquote> PART-1 </blockquote>
                             <br>
                             Consider the following Terms:<br>
                             Average Card Balance: The average card balance defined as the sum of cardholder’s balances at the end of the day divided by the total number of days. <br>
                             Let’s assume a person make 3 transactions in a month hence on 2nd, 22nd and 27th . Then his average car balance will be. <br>

                             MATHEMATICALLY: A on 2nd + A on 22nd + A on 27th     <br>
                                                      No of days in the month     <br>
                            Interest Rate: The interest rate is defined as amount of interest due per period. So, the interest rate is charged if the person do not pay the amount balance on time. Here it is of 15%.<br>
                            Credit Free Period: A credit free period is the extra time from the last date of statement given to a card holder to pay the balance. Here it is 15 days from the day when the statement is generated.<br>
                            Assumptions: In the given facts it is being asked what the assumptions on 3% credit card loss are:  My assumptions on the following statement is that whenever a issuer issues a credit card to the customer it takes some risk on the credit card, here I assumed risk to be the percentage loss on the total transaction made by the transactor.<br>
                            Means: Suppose a person made the transactions of Rs 50,000 in a month then 3% credit card loss means loss of 3% of Rs 50,000 i.e. Rs 1500. So this means the credit card company can bear a loss of Rs 1500  on transaction of total amount of Rs 50,000. <br>

                            <blockquote>PART-2</blockquote>

                            The SITUATION and the APPROACH to solve the situation and the MACHINE LEARNING model that helps categorizing profit according to types of people payments.<br>

                            <h3> Situation</h3> <br>
We are a credit card that issues credit cards to a group company like Oil company and Barista. So group provides some money to us because we are providing credit cards to them.<br>

<h3>Scenarios:</h3> <br>
There are 1000 customers which are divided in following groups.<br>
customers who pay the bill within the credit-free period <br>
customers paying 30 days after the last due date.<br>
customer paying 45 days after the last due date.<br>
customer paying 60 days after the last due date<br>
(remove these customers for the complete calculation of the next month, basically, you are not supposed to provide further credit services to these customers.<br>
 <h3>GIVEN FACTS:</h3> <br>
<blockquote>
 average card balance is Rs 1000 <br>
 each card has an interest rate of 15% <br>
 membership fee is Rs 20 per card <br>
 loss rate is 3% (NOTE: what are the interpretations of this? state your assumption CLEARLY when solving <br>
 Rs 25 operating cost per card <br>
 Rs 10 affiliation fee per card (cost to the group organization itself, so that their members get this awesome card program <br>
 6.5% cost of funds (that credit card company must pay to the bank where it gets money <br>
 bill/statement is issued on 1st of every month <br>
 credit-free period = 15 days from the bill/statement issue date. <br>

</blockquote> <br>
<br>
<h3>ANALYSIS:</h3> <br>
Let us first look up only on the facts given to us:<br>
Average Card Balance is Rs 1000: Now here this does not mean that at the end one should have a balance of Rs1000 at the end of the days of transaction. Here average card balance means the average balance amount of the month should be at least Rs1000.A person need to maintain this balance.<br>

Each card has an interest rate of 15%: If the person is unable to pay the amount within credit free period then he will be charged an interest which in this case is 15% and charged on daily basis because it is given that interest is simple interest.<br>
Membership fee is Rs 20 per card: Each cardholder must pay Rs 20 before buying the card.<br>
Loss rate is 3%: This is an interesting term. Whenever issuer issues a card to customer the issuer issued the card with some risk every month. <br>
<br>
<h3>Consider the following example:</h3><br>
          Suppose a person make transaction of Rs 10000 in the month then according to 3% the risk that issuer has is 3% of the transaction amount i.e. Rs300. <br>
Rs 25 operating cost per card: Here operating cost means the cost charged on the transaction made by the card holder. For e.g.: if a person made 3 transactions in the month so he needs to pay 25*3 = Rs 75 for three transactions.<br>
Rs 10 affiliation fee per card: This is also a one-time payment on the card whenever a customer buys the card.<br>
6.5% cost of funds: This means the company need to pay 6.5% of cost paid by the customer for the credit card he is using.<br>
Bill statement is issued on 1st of month: This means on 1st of every month one billing statement ends.<br>
Credit free period is 15 days: This means the extra time given to the customer to make the bill payment is of 15 days i.e. he /she needs to pay by 16 of next month.<br>
<br>
Based on following understanding consider the analysis in which I grab the data from Google (Kaggle) and tried to apply the above terms on that data.<br>

                 <h3>I will explain the project in three paragraphs:</h3></blockquote>

                               <h3>1) Problem we were solving </h3> <br>
    The company has numerous employees
     About 60 in office
    Many thousands working in field

Therefore the communication was not possible in watsappp and hence wants a seperate chatapp for all employees.

Also the company wants a separate platform where an employee, teacher or a student can login .<br>

                              <h3>2) Solution:</h3><br>

  The solution of the following project is that the appliccation should be a GROUP CHAT where all employees talk in a group .
Therefore I prepared a web application in socketio in python which is a group chatting application where all employees can easily :
       1) Call anyone easily.
       2) Share documents
       3) Also take photos.<br>

     <h3>3) Result</h3><br>

The results were good . We recieved 70% good reviews from all employees about chatapp , they started playing with it .

 But since network is required for chatting but in rural areas the network facilities were not upto the mark therefore few employees were unhappy with requirements of good network connectivity.<br> </p>
