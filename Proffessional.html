                        <h4><a href="http://www.b-able.in/">B-able</a></h4>
                        Basix Academy for Building Lifelong Employbilities, B-ABLE a company focused on private and non-private Projects
                        and help rural , urban and semi-urban people to take part in the projects by becoming an entrepreneur along with
                        training .
                        <h4><a href="https://www.essilorseechange.com/what-we-do/2-5-new-vision-generation/eye-mitra/">Eyemitra</a></h4>
                        Esselore is world's top 3 spectacles organisation and started project Eyemitra in India with the vision of : <br>
                        1) Providing opportunity to rural , semi-urban and urban people to start their business shops using eye-mitra. <br>
                        2) Helping rural , semi-urban and urban people to have right spectacles with them .<br>


                        <blockquote>Problem team was solving</blockquote><br>
                        There are thousands of eyemitra shops in UP, Rajasthan , MP and growing more. <br>
                        And eyery state has one eyemitra office consisting of few business developers to gather daily information
                        of eyemitra shops . Now since there are tons of shops and therefore they use to travel hundreds of kilometers on bike
                        Therefore it took about a month to cover 200 shops of one region and thereofore the Data Analytics team analyse the deep
                        insights after a month with half data only making delay in taking business decisions.



                        <blockquote>Solution Planned</blockquote><br>
                        Now this is where technology enters and me with my team come up with an solution. We have 2 solutions in our mind.<br>
                        <br>

                        a) Prepare a simple google form and circulate it everywhere. This consist of no hard work but the major problem is
                           as a user why will I fill a form specially when I am unable to understand english , also taking a lot of time and
                           as an entrepreneur a user don't have so much of time.<br>
                          <br>
                        b) This is the loveliest part for me where we innovate this problem with the help of <b>Multi Lingual Voice Assistant</b>
                          which will just ask 4 questions in <b>HINDI</b> from user and the user will reply in Hindi , so like this we will have data
                          of all eyemitras in just a minute at the backend making the complete process much easier by consuming a huge amount of time.<br>
                          <br>

                        c) This was the extended version of <b>Multi Lingual Voice Assistant</b>. Since we are able to collect all the data at backend
                          so team planned to prepare a pipeline of not just getting data but also analysing it along with a prediction model of
                          <b>NVG sales going to happen in future</b>. This will automate the whole process .



                        <h4>How solution is helping and overcoming the problem </h4><br>

                        I planeed to use Dialoglow , since it the easiest platform of building customised multi-lingual voice assistant and along with
                        that planned to use python flask at the backend for collecting the user data, saving it in database and use for analysis .
                        The data we were getting is obviously in Hindi , therefore used Google apis to convert the data in enlish from Hindi making the process
                        of analysing it easy. I along with my team designed the questions to be asked from Entrepreneurs which were related to: <br>
                        1) Their name.<br>
                        2) Father's occupation. <br>
                        3) Region where the live. <br>
                        4) Their sales for today of eyemitra as well as non-eyemitra spectacles. <br>
                        The above questions are in Hindi, also shown in above video whose replies are first getting stored in python and from python to sql.
                        Then this data is use for making prediction model and analysing sales for each day.



                        <h4>What is the functional flow of the voice assistant </h4><br>
                        The voice assistant is embedded in google so the Entrepreneurs on field start the conversation for giving their data on EOD and their
                        data is recieved at the backend and from backend it gets saved in sql database and then used for analysis and prediction modelling.

                        <blockquote>Problems Faced</blockquote> <br>
                        A chatbot sprecially when it is a Voice assistant is just like a small baby which needs to learn a lot and therefore just after the
                        completion of the voice assistant me and team took it in field where it get failed in first test. So, we first trained it for next whole month
                        and then again took it to field and found that bot is now capable of undestanding every assent of Hindi. To understand this concept much better
                        I am attaching a video by Google on "Age of AI". <br>
                        <hr><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5aZjsWM2wo&t=973s">Age of AI (Explaining how a bot learns)</a></h4>



                        <blockquote>Results</blockquote> <br>
                        Bot is now well enough trained to understand the words of Hindi in almost every assent.

                                Problem: According to real survey from existing users
                                the company found that there are more people
                                who want to study books at the library rather that online
                                due to few numerous reasons like:
                                  <blockquote>  1) They were able to meet friends in library for a group study especially college going students.
                                    2)  Many house wifes feel bored and alone , so in that case only books can be a great reason for passing their time.
                                  </blockquote>
                                Therefore company want to build a business solution that
                                can help all people to study books offline or online as per their choice.
                                Solution: So , I decided to prepare a online business bookstore whose main purpose is:
                                  <blockquote>
                                    a)  To let users reserve their books online and come to offline store , collect the book and study.
                                    b) Also I gave a chance to people to issue their books online and collect from offline library store and take home.
                                  </blockquote>
                                How company is making business:
                                Reserve and Issue any Book with a small plan of Rs 100   every month or for free trial reserve and study books at   library(hurry up time is going)

                                <h3>1) Problem we were solving </h3> <br>
     The company has numerous employees
      About 60 in office
     Many thousands working in field

Therefore the communication was not possible in watsappp and hence wants a seperate chatapp for all employees.

Also the company wants a separate platform where an employee, teacher or a student can login .<br>

                               <h3>2) Solution:</h3><br>

   The solution of the following project is that the appliccation should be a GROUP CHAT where all employees talk in a group .
Therefore I prepared a web application in socketio in python which is a group chatting application where all employees can easily :
        1) Call anyone easily.
        2) Share documents
        3) Also take photos.<br>

      <h3>3) Result</h3><br>

The results were good . We recieved 70% good reviews from all employees about chatapp , they started playing with it .

  But since network is required for chatting but in rural areas the network facilities were not upto the mark therefore few employees were unhappy with requirements of good network connectivity.<br> </p>
